# Realtime-Object-Detection-and-handwritten-solver
This is a deep learning model based project developed by me and my college teammates in final year.
This model used Mobilenet SSD model Which is a pretrained model for object detection and in a equation solver u have to train manually neuralNet.
There is a project pdf file which explains u all about my project.
