# Realtime-Object-Detection-and-handwritten-solver
This is a deep learning model based project developed by me and my college teammates in final year.
This project contains two model in which model-1 used Mobilenet SSD model Which is a pretrained model for object detection and in model-2 equation solver u have to train manually neuralNet.
There is a project pdf file which explains u all about my project.

1.main branch contains only readme section.

2.sub-branch name model-1 contains realtime object detection project.

3.sub-branch name model-2 contains handwritten equation solver.
